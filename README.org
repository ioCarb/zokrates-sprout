* how to
+ just run ~cargo build~
  + a grpc server will be started which accepts messages defined by vm_instance.proto sent by the w3bstream-prover
+ messages (datas[]) are appended as they are in the by default and passed to zokrates split by spaces
  + if you have comma separated values however the messages are reorderd by the location they have in relation to the comma
    ~fn main( field[2]A, field B, field[2] C)~ to ~fn main(field[2]A, field B, field[2] C field[2]A1, field B1, field[2] C1)~, but with the comma thing the fn could be ~fn main(field[4]A, field B[2], field[4] C)~. for more information: [[file:src/utils.rs::7][see group_by()]]
* TODOs
+ abi encode/hexify proof
+ cleanup unused curves (cleanup code in general)
+ write tests
+ store projects in db or fs instead of memory
* caveats (huge todos)
+ zokrates cannot export curves other then Bn128 to eth so we also dont compute proofs, as we couldnt use them anyways
